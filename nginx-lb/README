Setup:
======

1. Edit file nginx-lb.conf with the IP addresses of all the master's in the cluster.
2. Start the lb with: 
	$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
3. Stop the lb with:
	$ docker-compose stop
4. Once installed, edit the kube proxy config on every master:

	$ kubectl edit configmap kube-proxy -n kube-system
		look for "server:" and replace the address in it with the virual ip as follows:  "server: https://<virtual ip>:16443"
5. Restart all the kube-proxy's (deleting exiting ones will restart it):
	$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep proxy    // List all proxy's running
	$ kubectl delete pod --namespace=kube-system kube-proxy-wqm2h // Command to use to delete proxy

6. To make sure the kube proxy has come up right, check the proxy logs:
	$ kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system kube-proxy-w2sn2 | less

Troubleshooting:
================

To cleanup nginx lb:
Go to the directory where the compose file is and issue:
 1. docker-compose ps // to view the status of the lb
 2. docker-compose stop // to stop the stack
 3. docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml rm -f //Remove/delete the stack
